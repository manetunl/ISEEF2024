          <h3>What is a stroke and what happens before it?</h3>
          <p>It is a damage to a part of the brain, which occurs due to the interruption of blood flow to the brain for a long period, causing the wonderful function controlled by this part of the brain Transient ischemic attack (silent transient thrombotic stroke): occurs when blood flow to part of the brain stops for a short period of time, and temporary symptoms appear that last from a few minutes to a few hours, and do not cause permanent damage to the brain, as it is a serious warning sign that a stroke Stroke may occur in the future and should not be ignored. The cause is usually:<br>Reduced blood flow in a narrow part of the main artery that carries blood to the brain.
            A blood clot travels from another part of the body (such as the heart) to the brain.
            Narrowing and blockage of small blood vessels in the brain; Which leads to difficulty blood flow for a short period of time, </li>

          <h3>Types of stroke And Reason</h3>
          <p>Ischemic (thrombotic) stroke: It occurs due to blockage of the blood vessels carrying blood to the brain, by fatty deposits or a blood clot (blood clot) originating from a place in the body, usually the heart.
            Hemorrhagic (bleeding) stroke: Bleeding is caused by a burst or ruptured blood vessel that results in swelling and pressure in the brain; Which leads to damage to cells and tissues, and in most cases may lead to death, and has several causes, one of which is irregular high blood pressure.<BR><BR> the reason:<br>
              The brain needs a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients in order to function normally, and when a stroke occurs, the supply of oxygen to the brain stops, which leads to the death of brain cells after a few minutes. This results in a deficit in brain function, which may include problems with movement, speech, thinking, control of bowel and bladder functions, and other vital functions of the body, and the cause of its occurrence is still unknown.</p>

          <h3>Evaluation and Treatment of Stroke</h3>
          <p>The doctor needs to evaluate the type of stroke and the areas of the brain affected by it. He also needs to rule out other possible causes for the symptoms (such as: a brain tumor or a reaction to a drug). Therefore, the doctor may use several tests to determine the risk of stroke, including: CT scan, MRI, or cardiovascular tests.<BR>
            <BR>Treatment depends on the type of stroke and the time since symptoms began, but often includes:
            Medications: It is usually by taking one or more different medications, as some may be taken immediately and for a short period (such as: blood thinners), while others may need to be taken in the long term, but when diagnosed immediately, the affected person is given a clot buster. intravenous route; To improve blood flow to the part of the brain, but it should be used in the first three or four hours of the injury.</p>
